# Water Supply Management Project
## Overview
This project addresses the critical challenge of water supply management in Indore, where efficient distribution from the Narmada River to households is hindered by a lack of comprehensive monitoring and data analysis. The current system lacks mechanisms to measure and track water distribution at the household level, leading to inefficiencies, potential wastage, and challenges in equitable distribution.

## Problem Statement
Indore relies on the Narmada River for its water supply. Although the intake from the river is monitored, the city lacks the infrastructure to effectively measure and manage water distribution to households. This gap results in:

* Inability to identify and address water wastage or leakages.
* Difficulties in ensuring equitable distribution of water.
* Lack of data for informed decision-making regarding maintenance and system upgrades.
## Objectives
1. Implementation of Monitoring Systems: Develop and deploy both digital and physical systems to measure the amount of water received by each household in Indore.
2. Data Collection and Analysis: Establish a system for continuous data collection on water usage per household, enabling detailed analysis and reporting.
3. Reporting and Management: Generate monthly and yearly reports on water distribution and usage, highlighting trends, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.
4. Equitable Distribution: Ensure equitable water distribution across all households to prevent shortages and address disparities.
5. Leakage Detection and Prevention: Utilize data to identify potential leakages or wastage in the distribution network and implement timely corrective actions.
   
## Implementation
Web Interface
* Technologies Used: React, Firebase Realtime Database
* Features:
  * Real-time Data Display: The interface shows up-to-date water flow information, predicted water quality, and various visualizations.
  * Visualizations:
    * Line Charts: Display water consumption and leakage data for rural and urban areas.
    * Pie Charts: Illustrate distribution patterns and water usage proportions.
  * Reports: Generate and view monthly and yearly reports on water distribution, leakage, and consumption.
## Data Collection and Analysis
* Integration: The system integrates Arduino IoT sensors to collect real-time data, which is sent to Firebase Realtime Database.
* Machine Learning Models: The collected data is used to train and evaluate machine learning models to predict water quality and optimize distribution strategies.
## Features
* Real-time Updates: Continuous monitoring and real-time updates on water usage and system performance.
* Trend Analysis: Analyze water consumption patterns and detect potential issues such as leakage or inefficiencies.
* Reporting: Access detailed monthly and yearly reports to support strategic decision-making and management.

## Future Work
* Enhanced Machine Learning Models: Improve the accuracy of predictions and analytics.
* Scalability: Expand the system to cover additional areas and integrate with other data sources.
* User Interface Improvements: Enhance the web interface for better user experience and accessibility.
